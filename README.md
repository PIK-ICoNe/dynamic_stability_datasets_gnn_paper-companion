# dynamic_stability_datasets_gnn_paper-companion

This repository contains the code to reproduce the datasets published on Zenodo: https://zenodo.org/record/6572973 as well as the code to train models of the corresponding paper. The datasets are generated using Julia and for the training of the ML models Pytorch is used.


## Generation of the datasets
The generation of the datasets occurs in multiple steps. To reproduce the results, we reccommend using Julia 1.5.3 and use the provided Project.toml and Manifest.toml to have the same environment. The corresponding path to activate the environment has to be set in all files.

1. Grid generation: generate_grids_and_seeds.jl
2. Dynamical computation: compute_dynamics.jl
3. Preparation for  ML training: prepare4Pytorch.jl

Prior to executing the scripts, the paths to store/loading the grid data and store/loading the dynamical results, as well as the number of desired nodes per grid must be adapted in generate_grids_and_seeds.jl and compute_dynamics.jl. Furthermore, the path to the girds, dymnamical results and the output directory for the ML data has to be set in prepare4Pytorch.jl.

## Traning of the ML models
To evaluate the reproducibility, we provide one Jupyter notebook and a python script to train the ArmaNet model after automatically downloading the datasets from Zenodo. We provide a conda environment file to generate a conda environment including all of the necessary software. 
To create the conda environment, the ENVNAME can be freely chosen.
conda env create -n ENVNAME --file conda_environment.yml

Afterwards the script train_ArmaNet.py or train_ArmaNet.ipynb can be executed.
